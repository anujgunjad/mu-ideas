                <p style="text-align:justify;">A mentor is someone who accepts the responsibility of guiding a mentee on aspects of business, or life, that the mentor may have a longer experience on. 
Thus, in the context of a startup, a mentor’s role is to provide perspective on the direction that the venture may take, and providing inputs and advice on how that idea can be converted into a venture. 
This means that the mentor should not just give opinion on what he/she feels is right, but should see the venture in the context of the individual mentee’s circumstances and then help the mentee take necessary decisions. Join the mentor community of MU Ideas.
